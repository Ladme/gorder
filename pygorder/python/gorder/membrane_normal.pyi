class DynamicNormal:
    r"""
    Request a dynamic local membrane normal calculation.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    heads : str
        Selection query specifying reference atoms representing lipid headgroups
        (typically phosphorus atoms or phosphate beads). Must be exactly one
        atom/bead per lipid molecule.
    radius : float
        Radius of the sphere used to select nearby lipids for membrane normal
        estimation. Recommended value is half the membrane thickness. Must be
        greater than 0.
    collect : Optional[Union[bool, str]], default=False
        Determines whether dynamic membrane normals are saved and exported.
        By default (`False`), normals are not saved.
        If `True`, normals are saved internally and accessible via the Python API, but not written to a file.
        If a string is provided, normals are saved and written to the specified output file.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ConfigError
        If `radius` is not positive.
