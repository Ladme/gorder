## Example configuration files & scripts

The subdirectories `atomistic`, `coarse_grained`, and `united_atoms` contain several examples of configuration files that can be used to perform your analyses with minimal modifications.

The subdirectory `python` contains several example Python scripts using `gorder`'s Python API.

These examples do not, by any means, represent the full capabilities of the `gorder` program.

See the [gorder manual](https://ladme.github.io/gorder-manual/) for more information about what `gorder` can (and can't) do.
