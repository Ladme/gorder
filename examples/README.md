## Example configuration files

This subdirectory contains several examples of configuration files that can be used to perform your analyses with minimal modifications.
These examples do not, by any means, represent the full capabilities of the `gorder` program.

See the [gorder manual](https://ladme.github.io/gorder-manual/) for more information about what `gorder` can (and can't) do.
