### Input Gromacs binary run file.
structure: system.tpr

### Input Gromacs compressed trajectory file.
trajectory: traj.xtc

### Calculate coarse-grained order parameters.
analysis_type: !CGOrder

  ### Analyze all bonds between particles of the membrane.
  beads: "@membrane"

### Assign lipids into leaflets based on the global center of geometry of the membrane.
leaflets: !Global

  ### All particles of the membrane for center of geometry calculation.
  membrane: "@membrane"

  ### Phosphate beads of membrane lipids identifying lipid heads. Only one phosphate bead per molecule!
  heads: "name PO4"

  ### Perform the leaflet assignment only for the first trajectory frame and 
  ### then use the same assignment for all the following frames.
  ### DELETE if lipids are able to flip-flop in your membrane!
  frequency: !Once

### Path to the output yaml file. Contains full results of the analysis.
output_yaml: order.yaml

### Path to the output "table" file. Simple to read.
output_tab: order.tab

### Path to the output xvg file. Can be plotted using `xmgrace`.
output_xvg: order.xvg

### Path to the output csv file. Open with a spreadsheet software or read with Pandas/Polars.
output_csv: order.csv

### Perform the analysis using 4 threads.
n_threads: 4
